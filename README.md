This project implements a voice-controlled interface for interacting with the Notepad application. The goal of this project is to enable users to control various functions of the Notepad application using voice commands, thereby providing a hands-free and intuitive method of interaction. This technology allows for the conversion of spoken language into written text, providing a more accessible and efficient means of communication. The development of speech recognition systems has been driven by the increasing demand for hands-free and intuitive interfaces for devices and applications.  These systems have a wide range of applications, including voice assistants, medical prescriptions, transcription services, call center automation, and language translation. In this project, we will explore the development of a speech-to-text and vice versa using Google Cloud API integrated with notepad. The goal of this project is to create a system that can accurately and reliably transcribe spoken language into text and vice versa, providing a valuable tool for individuals, as well as improving communication and productivity in various industries.
